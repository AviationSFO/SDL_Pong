# SDL Pong
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game I made to test my new knowledge of SDL in C++. The fish as the paddles is intentional because I wanted to spice things up a bit. The game is very simple and I added a little AI that act as the opponent for you guys who have no friends.

## Features
- Simple Pong Game
- SDL2 graphics

# Installation
## Normal People
For most people who acctually want to play the game, you can download the compiled .exe from the latest release.

## Source Code
As for the rest of you, if you want the source code to contribute to the project, you can clone it with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AviationSFO/SDL_Pong.git
```
In order to edit and compile the source code, you need to install the following dependencies:

* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release-2.0.php)
* [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release-2.0.php)
* Make

Make sure you have everything set up properly for vscode and mingw.

That means you should have a working environment with the following:
* Everything included in the source code download
* src directory with include and lib directories
* And all the DLLs from the various SDL parts for the project
