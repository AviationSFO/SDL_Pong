# SDL Pong
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game I made to test my new knowledge of SDL in C++. The fish as the paddles is intentional because I wanted to spice things up a bit. The game is very simple and I added a little AI that act as the opponent for you guys who have no friends.

## Features
- Simple Pong Game
- SDL2 graphics

# Installation
Copy and paste into terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/AviationSFO/SDL_pong.git

Thanks to the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) project for the SDL2 library which I have included the DLLs for installed and ready in the project.
